# Apocalypse World roll20 Character Sheet

This is a private project that attempts to build a more functional and more visually appealing Apocalypse World 2e (as well es potentially Burned Over) character sheet for roll20.

As I have no prior experience in designing a character sheet for roll20 I use https://https://github.com/joesinghaus/Blades-template/tree/clean-sheet as a basis, so it will (at first) look pretty much identical. Even just reading through this as an example helped me understand a lot about what needs to be done, so thanks to Jakob for this template.

This project is not known to or endorsed by any of the authors of Apocalypse World 2e or any of its accompanying materials.
If any of them finds this and wants me to contact me about it, I invite them to contact me via Discord @cptKadse#2207.
